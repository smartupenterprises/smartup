                    <b>SmartUp Educational Institution</b>( Now registered as Limited Liability Partnership named <b>SmartUp Enterprises LLP</b> ) has been revolutionizing the field of education substantially in Mattanchery (Kerala), the largest slum area in South India which is home to a young generation without even primary level education, mostly in the clutches of drugs. <b>SmartUp Enterprises</b> 
                        has been doing the lion’s share of work in molding 7863 children into socially responsible citizens by identifying their interests and providing them with the means to get access to education. <b>SmartUp</b> has been in the forefront of this movement by finding around 153 job opportunities for the young generation by focusing their talents to co-curricular and extra-curricular activities.

               <!-- <h3>Our History</h3>
                <div class="col-md-6 para">
                <p><b>U</b>ntil 10 years back, Mattancherry, a district in Kerala, one of the most literate states of India, was extremely lacking in the education sector. According to reports by a few NGOs,
                   80% of the head of the families didn’t even have basic education. Moreover, a general lack of 
                   interest in studies, laziness, and a growing drug scene among the young generation led to the 
                   realization that only through the intervention of an academic community can there be a significant change in the existing conditions. This led to the foundation of <b>SmartUp</b>, an informal educational institution along with 6 others through play-way methods and night classes. The strength of the institution grew from a humble 63 students to a whopping number of 7568 students and 11 branches across West Cochin. Along with training students, academically bright students with an
                   aptitude for teaching are trained to be teachers, free of cost, turning them into future academicians, hence expanding the horizon of <b>SmartUp</b>. Students who have graduated from <b>SmartUp</b> are also encouraged to represent the educational and cultural organization of SmartUp, making sure that thousands of children are employed along with providing them with education. This process has reflected in the exponential growth of the institution. With time, thousands and lakhs of children will carry the ideals of 
                   <b>SmartUp</b> which will lead to the rise of a bright and socially responsible generation. </p> -->
                
               <!-- <p><b>W</b>hile traditional education is entirely teacher-oriented,<b> SmartUp</b> is heralding a system of holistic education that focuses on the triad of the teacher, student and parent through interesting presentations and reference classes with the help of the latest technology. In an age where education is considered omnipotent, <b> SmartUp </b> aims to achieve holistic development of the students by following the practice of developed countries where students work along with their studies to make sure of their all-round growth.</p> -->
                
                <p>Reiterating the fact that education is not a business, <b> SmartUp</b> believes in providing education as a service to make sure the children are elevated in both curricular and extracurricular through easy and simple learning. <b> SmartUp</b> focuses more on smart work as opposed to hard work using methods such as video classes, animation classes, smart classes, education games, and digital classes which has made <b>SmartUp</b> a household name among more than 7500 students.</p>

                <p><b>T</b>utors at<b> SmartUp</b> who are also technical experts use state of the art technology as aids to teaching which assures the best quality education to the children. LCD projectors, latest learning and teaching equipment, an environment suitable for effective learning, online classes, online notes, and online exams also provide students with the best in class facilities. One to one online tests are conducted to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the students and the required training is provided to the students.</p>
                <p><b>T</b>he tuition fee of a single student in Ernakulam, the commercial capital of Kerala, ranges around ₹1000 per subject. At the same time, <b>SmartUp</b> charges less than ₹90 for a subject. Economically backward students are taught for 25% lesser fees while destitute students are taught for free so that the students are molded into socially responsible citizens.</p>
                <p><b>T</b>his initiative began with the aim to completely transition Mattancherry region through the hands of a teacher. From teaching initiatives to motivational classes, awareness classes, football tournaments, Independence Day celebrations, Republic Day celebrations, felicitation programs, academic tours, <b>SmartUp</b> has made sure that its efforts have a holistic impact on the students. These efforts in reviving the academic community was awarded by the Kerala Legislative Assembly speaker <b>Shri. P Shriramakrishnan</b> for the total contribution to the educational and cultural arena.</p>
